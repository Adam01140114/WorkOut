# Gamification Draft for WorkSmart

A draft of ideas to make the calorie/workout tracker more engaging and rewarding.

---

## Implemented

### 1. **Pink confetti on workout completion** ✅
- Triggers when you log any workout (treadmill, stairs, hiking, mountain biking, weight lifted)
- Instant visual reward for completing an action

---

## Future Ideas

### 2. **Streak bonuses**
- Streak milestones: 7 days → special badge/celebration
- Streak "double-up" weekends: 2x points for logging on Saturday + Sunday
- Streak freeze: 1 skip per month (already logged today? Use freeze tomorrow)

### 3. **Points & levels**
- Earn points per workout (e.g., 10 pts base + bonus for calorie burn)
- Level up every N points (Level 1 → 2 → 3 …)
- Unlock titles: "Rookie", "Consistent", "Beast Mode", etc.

### 4. **Achievements / badges**
- "First Steps" – Log first workout
- "Week Warrior" – 7-day streak
- "Calorie Crusher" – Burn 1000 kcal in a day
- "Weight Room Regular" – 10 weight-lifted entries
- "Early Bird" – Log before 8am
- "Mountain Goat" – Log 5 hiking sessions
- "Iron Man" – 30-day streak

### 5. **Daily / weekly challenges**
- "Log 3 workouts this week"
- "Try a new workout type"
- "Hit your calorie burn goal 5 days in a row"

### 6. **Visual progress**
- Animated progress bar for streak goal (already exists)
- Unlockable themes or accent colors at milestones
- Chart annotations: "New PR!" on personal best days

### 7. **Social / sharing (optional)**
- Share streak to social (e.g., "I'm on a 12-day workout streak!")
- Private leaderboard with friends
- "Workout of the day" celebration card

### 8. **Sound & haptics**
- Subtle success sound on workout log (with mute option)
- Haptic feedback on mobile when logging
- Optional "power-up" sound for streak milestones

### 9. **Micro-celebrations**
- Different confetti colors per workout type
- Confetti on streak milestone (e.g., gold for 7-day)
- Small animation when hitting daily calorie goal

### 10. **Weight goal celebration**
- Special celebration when weight trajectory crosses goal line
- "Goal reached!" modal with confetti

1. ✅ Pink confetti (done)
2. Achievement badges (visual + stored in Firebase)
3. Different confetti per workout type or milestone
4. Points / levels
5. Daily challenges
6. Sound effects (opt-in)
